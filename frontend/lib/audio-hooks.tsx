/**
 * Unified hook that combines all audio contexts.
 * Use this for backward compatibility with existing code.
 *
 * NOTE: This hook uses RemoteAwareAudioControls which automatically routes
 * playback commands (play, pause, next, etc.) to the active player device.
 * When this device is NOT the active player, commands are forwarded via WebSocket.
 *
 * For optimal performance, prefer using the individual hooks:
 * - useAudioState() - for rarely changing data (currentTrack, queue, etc.)
 * - useAudioPlayback() - for frequently changing data (currentTime, isPlaying)
 * - useRemoteAwareAudioControls() - for remote-aware playback actions
